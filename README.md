# Mangler-DIP-Clip
This is a KiCad reworking of @unexpectedmaker SAMD21G-Mangler https://github.com/UnexpectedMaker/SAMD21G-Mangler or https://www.tindie.com/products/seonr/samd21g-mangler/ to add support for a clip style 48pin TQFP to 48pin DIP converter module.

This works for burning the bootloader with an Atmel ICE and usb programming through the USB however you will notice that I've also broken out pins to use this as a proto board.
These pins are at the moment only placeholders DO NOT USE AS LABELED.

I will be working on this over the next few days.
